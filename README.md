Video streaming app

**Installation:**
Prep: Please make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) running on your machine (or install if needed, use init_docker.sh script if not working)

1. git clone https://github.com/lifeBalance/hypertube-express
2. make dev in root directory (takes 3-4 minutes)
3. go to localhost in browser

**Stack:**
Node.js, Express, React, Redux, Vite, Tailview and PostgreSQL.
Docker (docker-compose). RESTful API.
Architectural pattern: MVC. 

**Only Project constraint:**
Libraries executing the transfer from a torrent to a video stream are forbidden: use of libraries such as webtorrent, pulsar or peerflix aretherefore considered cheating.
